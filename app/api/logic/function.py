    better indicators than anyone at your university, which itself is a better
    indicator than just anyone with a bachelors degree).

    #
    # Query B is easy, it just gets the User and Degree information of the user
    # we want to look up from the education table.
    #
    # Query A is harder. We start with education for the same info as B. Then
    # we join with experience to gain access to the postionID column, which we
    # then use to join with position, which gives us jobTitle and employerName.
    # We filter this by users that still exist in the table (in case a user was
    # deleted without removing their experience). Since this query does not
    # depend on variables, we can store it as a view to simplify the full query.
    #
    # Next, we join A and B on the condition that the userID is different,
    # essentially getting a cross product of our user with the work experience
    # of every other (current) user.

    # function which takes the education info of our user and the other user
    # to determine a relationship factor. We exclude the groups (jobs) which
    # have no relationship.
